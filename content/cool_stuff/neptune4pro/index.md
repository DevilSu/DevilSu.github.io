Saw this video from ShortCircuit at July, 2023 during my intership at Mediatek, Dan really sold this 3D printer to me :star_struck:
Dan at the end of the video: "God how is this so fxxking cheap I don't get it"

# First Setup
{{< figArray subfolder="images/first_setup" figCaption="The first setup of the 3D printer and my first prints" numCols="3">}}
This is my first setup of the 3D printer down in the basement in NW5 at Sep, 2023.
I made a enclosure out of an Amazon cardboard box to keep the temp, magnets are used to hold the door open/close.
Also bought a filament box to keep the filament dry, and can heat up the filament when printing. Since there is no WiFi, I use a RPi3 as WiFi-to-ethernet adapter to make the printer wireless.


# Second Setup
There were some issues with the first setup.
- The filament box is outside the chamber, feeding into the printer at a weird angle so the printhead has to pull harder
- The table wobbles a lot when printing

To solve this, I got a [nice cabinet](https://a.co/d/gu8medp) on Amazon to sit my printer on, and cut a piece of wood from Home Depot to put on the cabinet as a nice top. Then I modified the filament holder to make it smaller to fit into the cardboard box. The tube and the inserts(?) are from Amazon [(link)](https://a.co/d/h2typiv), can just screw the inserts into the printed part [(stl files)](https://www.printables.com/model/696254-neptune-4-pro-filament-holder-mod).

Yup no new issues so far (as for 2023-12-27)
