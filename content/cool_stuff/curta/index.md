Curta [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curta) is a cool fully mechanical calculator by Curt Herzstark in the 1930s. I saw a video from Tested where Adam shows his own Curta(s) and really want one ages ago, but the original calculator is sooo expensive. Then, a 3D printed Curta by Marcus Wu went on to Tested! Now I have a 3D printer, will 100% sure print this one day!
