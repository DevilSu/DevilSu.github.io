This [Anker car mount](https://a.co/d/7zTbF7j) is really solid, but the arm to base connection part broke so it won't hold the arm up. I saw the exact same issue in the comment section on the Amazon product page. Luckily, Anker's customer service sent a replacement without asking the broken parts back even mine was outside the 1-year warranty period, super nice.

But the magsafe charger part is still good, so... a free wireless charging stand for me :moneybag:
