{{< figArray subfolder="images" figCaption="The FAT middle cream and super detailed crust of my 3D printed oreo" >}}

This started with I had a little bit of left over black filament from the RC car project, so I decided to keep printing the crust til it runs out. Then I printed the cream using our lab's expensive Stratasys 3D printer (Thanks Alanson :sunglasses:). Have to say was a nice comfort food (print) to keep me sane during the prep for my thesis proposal at the end of August, 2024.
