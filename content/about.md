I'm a fifth year (ah just passed my thesis proposal Aug, 2024) Ph.D. student at University of Michigan in Electrical and Computer Engineering, advised by Prof. [Alanson Sample](http://www.alansonsample.com/).

I am a member of the [Interactive Sensing and Computing Lab](https://theisclab.com) along with [Yasha Iravantchi](https://yasha.xyz/), [Tom Krolikowski](https://www.tomkrolikowski.dev/), [Kunpeng Huang](https://kunpeng.dev/), [Cameron Haire](https://callmeron7.github.io/), and [Yaxuan Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zmCbWwsAAAAJ). \
(Shout out to former labmates [Amani Alkayyali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwvwxL0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sumukh Marathe](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sumukh-marathe/) as well!)

My research mainly focuses on building **sensor array** with **real time signal processing/ML** for **wireless sensing**.\
(maybe I am chasing real time demo too hard instead of trying to graduate, but real time demos are so cool!) \
Here is a list of what I am (or was) working on:
- FMCW Large Element Acoustic Array for Rendering Depth Scenes with Diffusion Model
- Multi-Object Tracking with Sensor Array Fusion (BLE Switched Antenna Array + Camera Array)
- 49-Element Wideband Mic Array for Multi-Sound Source Detection, Localization, Isolation, and Classification
- 60GHz SFCW mm-Wave Radar 3D PointCloud Reconstruction
- PoseID - Device-Free Pose Reconstruction with a wall of RFID tags
- Single Packet, Single Channel, Switched Antenna Array for RF Localization  
Ubicomp 2023, Oct @ Cancun
- TomoID: A Scalable Approach to Device Free Indoor Localization via RFID Tomography  
INFOCOM 2023, May @ NYC, my first paper :tada:

As a die-hard fan of Doraemon, my ultimate goal is to have a forth-dimension pocket!\
I also like to work on stuff I think is cool, hopfully I will have time to put them into the "cool stuff" tab.
