I'm a fourth year (yeah it's taking a while) Ph.D. student at University of Michigan in Electrical and Computer Engineering, advised by Prof. [Alanson Sample](http://www.alansonsample.com/).
I am a member of the [Interactive Sensing and Computing Lab](https://theisclab.com) along with [Yasha Iravantchi](https://yasha.xyz/), [Tom Krolikowski](https://www.tomkrolikowski.dev/), [Kunpeng Huang](https://kunpeng.dev/), [Cameron Haire](https://callmeron7.github.io/), and [Yaxuan Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zmCbWwsAAAAJ).
(Shout out to former labmates [Amani Alkayyali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwvwxL0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sumukh Marathe](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sumukh-marathe/) as well!)

My research mainly focuses on RF sensing for indoor localization and/or human activity recognition.\
Here is a list of what I am (or was) working on:
- Mic Array sound source visualization and localization!
- 60GHz SFCW radar (still working on it lol, but its really cool)
- PoseID - pose reconstruction with RFID tags
- Single Packet, Single Channel, Switched Antenna Array for RF Localization  
Ubicomp 2023, Oct @ Cancun
- TomoID: A Scalable Approach to Device Free Indoor Localization via RFID Tomography  
INFOCOM 2023, May @ NYC, my first paper :tada:

As a die-hard fan of Doraemon, my ultimate goal is to have a forth-dimension pocket!\
I also like to work on stuff I think is cool, hopfully I will have time to put them into the "cool stuff" tab soon!
