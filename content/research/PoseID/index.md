## Use a wall of RFID tags to get human pose!

{{< dvs_justify_align_text text="This was at early stages when playing with the impinj RFID reader around summer, 2019. I built a lazy ResNet to inference body keypoints from RFID tags reads (RSSI, Phase, and Read Rate). I still think its a cool demo that is running in real time. Maybe one day we will get back to this and push it pass the finish line to some where :bulb:. ">}}
